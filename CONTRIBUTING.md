# oneAPI Level Zero Tests Contribution Guidelines

We encourage anyone who wants to contribute to submit
[Issues](https://github.com/oneapi-src/level-zero-tests/issues) and
[Pull Requests](https://github.com/oneapi-src/level-zero-tests/pulls).

## C++ Coding Standards

* C++14 maximum support
* Avoid C Arrays, replace with `std::array<>` / `std::vector<>`
* Avoid "magic numbers"
* Avoid C-style memory allocations in favor of C++
* Use `nullptr` instead of `NULL`
* Donâ€™t add `void` to empty argument lists
* Use `std::unique_ptr` in place of `std::auto_ptr`

In addition, use the following naming conventions:

* Class - UpperCamelCase - `class MyClass`
* Class data member - snake_case_with_suffix - `MyClass::my_class_data_member_`
* Struct - UpperCamelCase - `struct MyStruct`
* Struct data member - snake_case - `MyStruct::my_struct_data_member`
* Function - snake_case - `void my_function()`
* Variable - snake_case - `int my_variable`
* Constant - snake_case - `const int my_constant`
* Enum - snake_case - `enum class my_enum`
* Enum member - snake_case - `my_enum::my_enum_member`
* Namespace - snake_case - `namespace my_namespace`
* Macro - CAPITALIZED_WITH_UNDERSCORES - `#define MY_MACRO`
* Module - snake_case - `my_module`
* GTEST Test cases will follow the [Given/When/Then naming convention][given_when_then]

## Code Formatting

Follow the [LLVM code formatting guidelines][llvm_code_formatting].

A [.clang-format](./.clang-format) file is included in this repository and
build targets are defined in [clang_tools.cmake](./cmake/clang_tools.cmake) in the [cmake](./cmake) directory for convenience. `clang-format` will
check and fix any formatting issues with your code, and `clang-format-check`
will check for issues and print a diff of the corrections required.

Examples:

```
cmake --build . --target clang-format-check
cmake --build . --target clang-format
```

[llvm_code_formatting]: https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html#source-code-formatting

## Kernels (SPV Files)

OpenCL C kernel source code (`.cl`) and binaries (`.spv`) should be placed in a
`kernels/` subdirectory of your test. The
`add_lzt_test` and `add_lzt_test_executable` CMake functions will search for
kernels in that directory.

Whenever you add or update any kernels, you must re-generate the SPIR-V binaries
and commit them with your changes. A specialized build of clang is required to
do this.

### Setup Clang to Build SPV From .cl
* git clone -b khronos/spirv-3.6.1 https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM.git llvm
* export LLVM_SRC_ROOT=<path_to_llvm>

* cd $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/tools
* git clone -b spirv-1.1 https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIR clang
* cd $LLVM_SRC_ROOT
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../
* make -j 4 (NOTE:careful with the number of threads you select, llvm compile can consume all the threads and resources on the system)
* sudo make install
* git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/libclcxx.git desired_path_to_opencl_cxx_headers
### Build SPV File From .cl
* (OpenCL C) `clang -cc1 -emit-spirv -triple spir64-unknown-unknown -cl-std=CL2.0 -include opencl.h -x cl -o test.spv test.cl`
* (OpenCL C++) `clang -cc1 -emit-spirv -triple spir64-unknown-unknown -cl-std=c++ -I <libclcxx dir> -x cl -o test.spv test.cl`
(Note: use "-triple spir-unknown-unknown" to generate 32-bit spv)

## Test Feature Assignment

When adding a new test one needs to ensure that the new test case has features and tags assigned for use in the Level Zero Test Report Generator.

Each test case has features and tags assigned based on criteria in the following file:

[level_zero_report_utils.py](scripts/level_zero_report_utils.py)

These features are used in the test run script:

[run_test_report.py](scripts/run_test_report.py)

See here for details on the L0 Test Report Tool: [README.md](scripts/README.md)

The features assigned are determined either manually by the test creator by updates to the python scripts or are associated to a given feature by naming convention.

Three tags are assigned per test:

* test_feature_tag = Overall Category of the Feature (discrete, advanced, basic, tools, negative, stress)
  * discrete = Tests for features specific to discrete devices
  * advanced = Tests using features that are considered not base functionality ie non-smoke tests
  * basic = Very basic functionality of L0, tests used to determine if the L0 stack is functional.
  * tools = Tests for Tools features.
  * negative = Tests verifying error functionality.
  * stress = Tests verifying longevity and high resource usage.
* test_feature = General Feature being tested.
  * oneAPI Level Zero Core Features
    * Driver Handles
    * Device Handling
    * Barriers
    * Command Lists
    * Images
    * Command Queues
    * Fences
    * Device Memory
    * Host Memory
    * Shared Memory
    * Events
    * Kernels
    * Image Samplers
    * Sub-Devices
    * Allocation Residency
    * Inter-Process Communication
    * Peer-To-Peer
    * Unified Shared Memory
    * Thread Safety Support
  * oneAPI Level Zero Tools Features
    * Program Instrumentation
    * API Tracing
    * SysMan Frequency
    * SysMan Device Properties
    * SysMan PCIe
    * SysMan Power
    * SysMan Standby
    * SysMan LEDs
    * SysMan Memory
    * SysMan Engines
    * SysMan Temperature
    * SysMan Power Supplies
    * SysMan Fans
    * SysMan Reliability & Stability
    * SysMan Fabric
    * SysMan Diagnostics
    * SysMan Device Reset
    * SysMan Device Properties
    * SysMan Events
    * SysMan Frequency
    * SysMan Scheduler
    * SysMan Firmware
    * SysMan Perf Profiles
    * Metrics
    * Program Debug
* test_section = grouping of the test associated with functionality being tested for overall test plans.
  * tools = Tests spanning all oneAPI Level Zero Tools
  * negative = Tests exercising support for handling negative/invalid user input, expected to be run with a validation layer ie ZE_ENABLE_VALIDATION_LAYER=1
  * stress = Tests tests which exercise the maximum limits of a given oneAPI Level Zero Driver
  * core = Tests spanning all oneAPI Level Zero Core Features, this is the oneAPI Level Zero Certification for Production Stability of an L0 Stack

If a test does not get a feature assigned, then the run_test_report.py with fail with: `ERROR: test case " + test_name + " has no assigned feature`
